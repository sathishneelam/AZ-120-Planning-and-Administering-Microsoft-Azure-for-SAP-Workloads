## Scenario
  
In preparation for deployment of SAP NetWeaver on Azure, with SQL Server as the database management system, Adatum Corporation wants to explore the process of implementing clustering on Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019.

## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Provision Azure compute resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments.

-   Configure operating system of Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment.

-   Provision Azure network resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments.

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription with the sufficient number of available DSv2 and Dsv3 vCPUs (one Standard_DS1_v2 VM with 1 vCPU and four Standard_D4s_v3 VMs with 4 vCPUs each) in the Azure region you intend to use for this lab

-   A lab computer running Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019 with access to Azure

> **Note**: Consider using **East US** or **East US2** regions for deployment of your resources.

## Exercise 1: Provision Azure compute resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments

Duration: 50 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure compute components necessary to configure Failover Clustering on Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019. This will involve deploying a pair of Active Directory domain controllers, followed by a pair of Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019 in the same availability set within the same virtual network. To automate the deployment of domain controllers, you will use an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template available from <https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc>

### Task 1: Deploy a pair of Azure VMs running highly available Active Directory domain controllers by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, and navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com

1.  If prompted, sign in with the work or school or personal Microsoft account with the owner or contributor role to the Azure subscription you will be using for this lab.

1.  In the Azure portal, click **+ Create a resource**.

1.  From the **New** blade, initiate creation of a new **Template deployment (deploy using custom template)**.

1.  Back on the **Custom deployment** blade, in the **Load a GitHub quickstart template** drop-down list, select the entry **active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc**, and click **Select template**.

    ![](images/module2-ex1-task1-step5.png)

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you can launch the deployment by navigating to Azure Quickstart Templates page at <https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates>, locating the template named **Create 2 new Windows VMs, create a new AD Forest, Domain, and 2 DCs in an availability set**, and initiating its deployment by clicking **Deploy to Azure** button.

1.  On the **Custom deployment** blade, click **Edit template**.

1.  On the **Edit template** blade, apply the following changes and select **Save**:

    -   in the line **78**, replace `"imageSKU": "2016-Datacenter",` with `"imageSKU": "2019-Datacenter",`.

1.  Back on the **Create a new AD Domain with 2 Domain Controllers** blade, specify the following settings and click **Review + create**, followed by **Create** to initiate the deployment:

    -   Subscription: *the name of your Azure subscription*

    -   Resource group: *the name of a new resource group* **az12001b-ad-RG**

### Task 3: Create and configure Azure VMs disks

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `$resourceGroupName` to the name of the resource group containing the resources you provisioned in the previous task:

    ```
    $resourceGroupName = 'az12001b-cl-RG'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command, to create the first set of 4 managed disks that you will attach to the first Azure VM you deployed in the previous task:

    ```
    $location = (Get-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName).Location

    $diskConfig = New-AzDiskConfig -Location $location -DiskSizeGB 128 -AccountType Premium_LRS -OsType Windows -CreateOption Empty

    for ($i=0;$i -lt 4;$i++) {New-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -DiskName az12001b-cl-vm0-DataDisk$i -Disk $diskConfig}
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command, to create the second set of 4 managed disks that you will attach to the second Azure VM you deployed in the previous task:

    ```
    for ($i=0;$i -lt 4;$i++) {New-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -DiskName az12001b-cl-vm1-DataDisk$i -Disk $diskConfig}
    ```

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the first Azure VM you provisioned in the previous task (**az12001b-cl-vm0**).

    ![](images/module2-ex1-task2-step6.png)

1.  From the **az12001b-cl-vm0 - Disks** blade, attach data disks with the following settings to az12001b-cl-vm0:

    -   LUN: **0**

    -   Disk name: **az12001b-cl-vm0-DataDisk0**

    -   Resource group: *the name of the resource group you used when deploying the pair of **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter** Azure VMs in the previous task*

    -   HOST CACHING: **Read-only**

1.  Repeat the previous step to attach the remaining 3 disks with the prefix **az12001b-cl-vm0-DataDisk** (for the total of 4). Assign the LUN number matching the last character of the disk name. For the last disk (LUN **4**), set HOST CACHING to **None**.

    ![](images/module2-ex1-task2-step7.png)

1.  Save your changes. 

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the second Azure VM you provisioned in the previous task (**az12001b-cl-vm1**).

1.  From the **az12001b-cl-vm1** blade, navigate to the **az12001b-cl-vm1 - Disks** blade.

1.  From the **az12001b-cl-vm1 - Disks** blade, attach data disks with the following settings to az12001b-cl-vm1:

    -   LUN: **0**

    -   Disk name: **az12001b-cl-vm1-DataDisk0**

    -   Resource group: *the name of the resource group you used when deploying the pair of **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter** Azure VMs in the previous task*

    -   HOST CACHING: **Read-only**

1.  Repeat the previous step to attach the remaining 3 disks with the prefix **az12001b-cl-vm1-DataDisk** (for the total of 4). Assign the LUN number matching the last character of the disk name. For the last disk (LUN **4**), set HOST CACHING to **None**.

## Exercise 4: Remove lab resources

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will remove resources provisioned in this lab.

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open Cloud Shell pane and choose PowerShell as the shell.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `$resourceGroupName` to the name of the resource group containing the pair of **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter** Azure VMs you provisioned in the first exercise of this lab:

    ```
    $resourceGroupNamePrefix = 'az12001b-'
    ```

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to list all resource groups you created in this lab:

    ```
    Get-AzResourceGroup | Where-Object {$_.ResourceGroupName -like "$resourceGroupNamePrefix*"} | Select-Object ResourceGroupName
    ```

1. Verify that the output contains only the resource groups you created in this lab. These groups will be deleted in the next task.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to delete the resource groups you created in this lab

    ```
    Get-AzResourceGroup | Where-Object {$_.ResourceGroupName -like "$resourceGroupNamePrefix*"} | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force  
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have removed the resources used in this lab.
