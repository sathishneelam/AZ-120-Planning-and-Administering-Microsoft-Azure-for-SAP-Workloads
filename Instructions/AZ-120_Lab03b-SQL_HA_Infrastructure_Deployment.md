    -   Address ranges (CIDR block): **10.0.2.0/24**

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `$resourceGroupName` to the name of the resource group containing the resources you provisioned in the previous task:

    ```
    $resourceGroupName = 'az12003b-ad-RG'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the virtual network created in the previous task:

    ```
    $vNetName = 'adVNet'

    $subnetName = 'sapSubnet'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the Resource Id of the newly created subnet:

    ```
    $vNet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $vNetName

1.  To verify the resulting configuration, Within the RDP session to i20-ascs-0.adatum.com, from the **Tools** menu in Server Manager, start **Failover Cluster Manager**.

1.  In the **Failover Cluster Manager** console, review the **az12003b-ascs-cl0** cluster configuration, including its nodes, as well as is witness and network settings. Note that the cluster does not have any shared storage.


### Task 7: Set permissions on the \\\\GLOBALHOST\\sapmnt share

In this task, you will set share-level permissions on the **\\\\GLOBALHOST\\sapmnt** share.

> **Note**: By default, the Full Control permissions are granted only to the ADATUM\Student account. 

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to i20-ascs-0.adatum.com, from the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, run the following:

    ```
    $remoteSession = New-CimSession -ComputerName SAPGLOBALHOST

    Grant-SmbShareAccess -Name sapmnt -AccountName 'ADATUM\Domain Admins' -AccessRight Full -CimSession $remoteSession -Force
   
    ```

### Task 8: Configure operating system prerequisites for installing SAP NetWeaver ASCS and database components

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to i20-ascs-0.adatum.com, from the Windows PowerShell ISE session, run the following to configure registry entries required to faciliate the installation of SAP ASCS components and the use of virtual names:

    ```
    $nodes = ('i20-db-0','i20-db-1')

    Invoke-Command $nodes {
        $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanworkstation\parameters'
        $registryEntry = 'DisableCARetryOnInitialConnect'
        $registryValue = 1
        New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryEntry -Value $registryValue -PropertyType DWORD -Force
    }

    Invoke-Command $nodes {
        $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA'
        $registryEntry = 'DisableLoopbackCheck'
        $registryValue = 1
        New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryEntry -Value $registryValue -PropertyType DWORD -Force
    }

    Invoke-Command $nodes {
        $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters'
        $registryEntry = 'DisableStrictNameChecking'
        $registryValue = 1
        New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryEntry -Value $registryValue -PropertyType DWORD -Force
    }
    ```

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have configured operating system of Azure VMs running Windows to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment


## Exercise 3: Remove lab resources

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will remove resources provisioned in this lab.

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open Cloud Shell pane and choose PowerShell as the shell.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `$resourceGroupName` to the name of the resource group containing the pair of **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter** Azure VMs you provisioned in the first exercise of this lab:

    ```
    $resourceGroupNamePrefix = 'az12003b-'
    ```

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to list all resource groups you created in this lab:

    ```
    Get-AzResourceGroup | Where-Object {$_.ResourceGroupName -like "$resourceGroupNamePrefix*"} | Select-Object ResourceGroupName
    ```

1. Verify that the output contains only the resource groups you created in this lab. These groups will be deleted in the next task.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to delete the resource groups you created in this lab

    ```
    Get-AzResourceGroup | Where-Object {$_.ResourceGroupName -like "$resourceGroupNamePrefix*"} | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force  
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have removed the resources used in this lab.
